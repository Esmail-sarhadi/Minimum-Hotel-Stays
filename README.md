# Minimum-Hotel-Stays
This project provides a solution to find the minimum number of hotel stays required to travel from the first city to the last city, given a maximum driving time limit per day. The solution uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue to efficiently compute the shortest paths considering hotel stays.
